Short Description:
This Bash script unpacks compressed files by first determining their compression type using the output of the file -b command (ignoring file extensions). It then decompresses files using the appropriate tool—gunzip, bunzip2, uncompress, or unzip—and places the decompressed output directly in the parent directory of the archive while leaving the original file intact. The script supports verbose output (with the -v flag) and recursive directory processing (with the -r flag). Finally, it prints a summary of how many archives were decompressed and exits with a status code equal to the number of failures.
